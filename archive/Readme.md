The googlecode-tags directory contains complete copies of Concurrent-Locks source code for each of the Concurrent-Locks
releases which were made while Concurrent-Locks was hosted in Subversion on Google Code: versions <=1.0.0, released
prior to September 2015.

Concurrent-Locks versions >1.0.0 (since September 2015), will be released from GitHub, and tags for those versions can
be found directly in the GitHub repository.
